## 📋 Next Steps for You

### 1. Update index.html

Replace the old file links:

**Old:**
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

**New:**
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">
<script src="js/main.js"></script>
<script src="js/home.js"></script>
<script src="js/form-handler.js"></script>
```

### 2. Create catalogo.html

Copy the structure from `Catalogo/index.html` but update:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/catalog.css">
<script src="js/main.js"></script>
<script src="js/products-data.js"></script>
<script src="js/catalog.js"></script>
```

### 3. Update Image References

Change navigation links from:
```html
<a href="Catalogo/index.html">Catálogo</a>
```

To:
```html
<a href="catalogo.html">Catálogo</a>
```

### 4. Add Product Images

Create `/images/` directory and add real product photos:
```
/images/
  ├── products/
  │   ├── product-1.jpg
  │   ├── product-2.jpg
  │   └── ...
  └── placeholder.jpg
```

### 5. Remove Old Files

Once new structure is tested and working:
```bash
rm -rf Catalogo/
rm styles.css
rm script.js
```
